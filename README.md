Hi! 

In my repositories I load the projects that I completed and those which I am working on.

I accomplished ML tasks on multiclass and binary classifications, segmentation, regression, clustering, NLP; and 
I uploaded some scripts used to develop some small-scale programs with the Python GUI.

I also published [open datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/die9origephit/datasets) obtained through web scraping or collected online, and I preprocessed them to be easily reusable by other users.

Furthermore, I tried to apply my domain knowledge in geoscience to accomplish some Data Science tasks using regression analysis and statistical tests.
