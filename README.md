Hi! 

I am currently a 23 year-old master's degree student willing to pursue a career in Data Science/Machine Learning.

In my repositories I load the projects that I completed and those which I am working on.

I accomplished ML tasks on multiclass and binary classifications, segmentation, regression, clustering, NLP; and 
I uploaded some scripts used to develop some small-scale programs with the Python GUI.

Not only did I load scripts, but I also published open data obtained through web scraping or different sources, and I preprocessed them to be easily reusable by other users.

Furthermore, I solved some exercises using PostgreSQL and I tried to apply my domain knowledge in geoscience to accomplish some Data Science tasks using regression analysis and statistical tests.
