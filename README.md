Hi! 

Iâ€™m currently a 23 year-old master student in Geophysics. I am planning a career in the Data Science/Machine Learning domain.

In my repositories, I put the projects that I accomplished and those which I am working on.

I accomplished tasks regarding classification of real world images, regression (for instance, salary prediction), clustering problems (like establishing which countries are in most difficult economic conditions) and Natural Language Processing.

Moreover, I tried to apply my domain knowledge in geoscience to solve some Data Science tasks (take a look to 'SPWLA_PDDA_SIG_machine_learning_competition' and 'Bachelor Thesis').
