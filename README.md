Hi! 

In my repositories, I load the projects that I accomplished and those which I am working on.

I accomplished tasks on classification of real world images, regression, clustering and Natural Language Processing.

Furthermore, I tried to apply my domain knowledge in geoscience to solve some Data Science tasks, using regression analysis and statistical tests.
