Hi! 

Iâ€™m currently a 23 year-old master student in Geophysics and I am planning a career in the Data Science/Machine Learning domain.

In my repositories, I put the projects that I accomplished and those which I am working on.

I accomplished tasks regarding classification of real world images, regression, clustering and Natural Language Processing.

Moreover, I tried to apply my domain knowledge in geoscience to solve some Data Science tasks, using regression analysis.
