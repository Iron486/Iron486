Hi! 

I am currently a 23 year-old master student in Geophysics and I am planning a career in Data Science/Machine Learning.

In my repositories, I load the projects that I accomplished and those which I am working on.

I accomplished tasks on multiclass and binary classifications, regression, clustering and Natural Language Processing.

Furthermore, I tried to apply my domain knowledge in geoscience to accomplish some Data Science tasks, using regression analysis and statistical tests.
