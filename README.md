Hi! 

Iâ€™m currently a 23 year-old master student in Geophysics. I am planning a career in the Data Science/Machine Learning domain.

In my profile, I put my projects that I accomplished or those in which I am working on.

I did projects regarding classification of real world images, regression (for instance, salary prediction) and clustering problems (like establishing which countries are in most difficult economic conditions).

But also, I tried to apply my domain knowledge in geoscience to solve some Data Science tasks (like I did in my Bachelor Thesis or with the Machine Learning contest in which I partecipated).
