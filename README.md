Hi! 

I am currently a 23 year-old master's degree student in Geophysics, willing to pursue a career in Data Science/Machine Learning.

In my repositories, I load the projects that I completed and those which I am working on.

I accomplished ML tasks on multiclass and binary classifications, regression, clustering, Natural Language Processing and 
I uploaded some scripts used to develop some programs with a simple Python GUI.

Furthermore, I performed some exercises using PostgreSQL and I tried to apply my domain knowledge in geoscience to accomplish some Data Science tasks using regression analysis and statistical tests.
